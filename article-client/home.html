                <h3 class="question">What is the software development life cycle?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The software development life cycle is a conceptual framework that putline the stages involved in the development of a software application from initial feasibility stdu through deployment and maintenance.</p>

                <h3 class="question">What are three broad categories of SDLC models?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The three categories of SDLC models are, the first is Linear Models which is a sequential models where one stage leads to the next (e.g. Waterfall). The second is the Iterative Models which is a model the revisit earlier stages for continuous improvement (e.g. Spiral). The third one is Combined Models which is a mix of linear and iterative approaches.</p>

                <h3 class="question">How does the Waterfall Model work?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The Waterfall Model is a sequential development approach ehre progresses flows through predifined stages: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. It was modified by Winston Royce to include feedback loops.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="question">How does a model differ from a methodology in SDLC?</h3>
                <p class="answer">A model is descriptive and explains what to do, while a methodology is prescriptive and explains how to do it.</p>

                <h3 class="question">What improvement does the B-model introduce over the waterfall model?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The B-model extends the waterfall model by incorporating an operational lifecycle (maintenance cycle) to enable continuous improvements and avoid obsolescence.</p>

                <h3 class="question">What is the key difference between the spiral model and the waterfall model?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The spiral model is risk-driven and iterative, allowing for continuous feedback and risk assessment, whereas the waterfall model follows a strict sequential process.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="question">What is the V-model, and how does it improve quality assurance?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The V-model is a variation of the waterfall model that integrates verification and validation processes at each stage to ensure that requirements and designs are verifiable.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="question">How does the Unified Process Model differ from the waterfall and spiral models?</h3>
                <p class="answer">The Unified Process Model is model-based and use-case-driven, focusing on iterative development and incorporating object-oriented principles.</p>

                <h3 class="question">What are the key principles of Rapid Application Development (RAD)?</h3>
                <p class="answer">RAD emphasizes prototyping, iterative development, active user participation, and quick delivery by avoiding rigid planning.</p>

                <h3 class="question">What are some future considerations for SDLC models?</h3>
                <p class="answer">Future SDLC models may incorporate knowledge from other domains like behavior analysis, business management, and agile methodologies to improve efficiency and adaptability.</p>
